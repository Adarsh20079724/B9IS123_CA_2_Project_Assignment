Company name : Wanderon

Description/Discussion Submitted : Traditional travel companies typically provide pre-designed, fixed itineraries that lack personalization. When travelers seek customized plans, they must repeatedly contact customer service teams, leading to delays and communication inefficiencies. This project aims to reduce this by empowering users to create, modify, and remove their own personalized itineraries independently.
